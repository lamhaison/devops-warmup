In this simple exercise, you need to set up a simple deployment workflow using your tool of choice.

Imagine that your team is working on an awesome [API service](https://github.com/chatwing/sample-api), but they are a bunch of developers and clueless when it comes to server management and stuff. Your task is to set up the infrastructure for the above project using your favorite tools (Ansible, Saltstack, Chef, Puppet etc...). After that, you also need to set up a simple deployment process for the project using your favorite tools.

The goal is to have a separate git repository dedicated for managing the infrastructure and deploying the project.

API service specifications:
- Platform: NodeJS 5.x+
- Data storage: Redis 3.x+

**NOTE:** Please put your work in a git repository (preferably github)
